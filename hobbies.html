              Probably my biggest hobby is reading because I enjoy learning new
              things from books. I read 7 books through the summer. I
              enjoy reading nonfiction books that teach me something or help
              myself become a better version of me.

              Another hobby of mine is working out. I believe staying healthy
              and in control of your body is important and beneficial to your
              life and mind.

              Finally, music. I enjoy all sorts of music.
